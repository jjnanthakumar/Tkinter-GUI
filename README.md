# Tkinter-python-2.7
Implementing some codes in Tkinter
Note: 
1) Here I have used Python 2.x version, so you may need python 2.x version for this code execution.
2) Even you can use tkinter in python 3.x but little bit changes needed in fucntion calls and names.
For python 3.x refer this documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html and modify my code.

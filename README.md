# Tkinter-GUI
Implementing some codes in Tkinter
Note: 
1) Here I have used Python 2.x version, so you may need python 2.x version for this code execution.
2) Even you can use tkinter in python 3.x but little bit changes needed in fucntion calls and names.
For python 3.x refer this documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html and modify my code.
3) Here I have uploaded .exe files for Hangman and Flames, for that I have converted python2.x code to python 3.x.
   (because python2 no longer supported for pyinstaller)
4) I have uploaded all codes in a python 3.x version.
*Icon files must be downloaded if you are gonna choose .exe file
